### Other Techniques and Tools:
‚Ä¢ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Used for image classification, object detection, applying multiple filters to extract different features
‚Ä¢ **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT):** Used for object recognition, image matching, 3D reconstruction
‚Ä¢ **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG):** Used for object detection, especially in detecting pedestrians
‚Ä¢ **Optical Flow:** Used for tracking objects in video, estimating 3D structure, detecting motion

‚Ä¢ Graph-based Image Segmentation RAGs (Region Adjacency Graphs)
‚Ä¢ **Definition:** Representation of neighboring relationships in an image
‚Ä¢ **Components:** Regions (connected pixels with shared properties) as vertices, neighboring regions as edges
‚Ä¢ **Applications:** Image segmentation, object recognition
