### Process of identifying a contrail:
```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Start]
  A --> B{Dark?}
  B --> |No| C1[Not a contrail]
  B --> |Yes| D{Line-shaped?}
  D --> |No| E1[Not a contrail]
  D --> |Yes| F{Appears suddenly or from sides?}
  F --> |No| G1[Not a contrail]
  F --> |Yes| H{Visible in 2+ images?}
  H --> |No| I1[Not a contrail]
  H --> |Yes| J{10+ pixels, 3x longer \n than wide at least once?}
  J --> |No| K1[Not a contrail]
  J --> |Yes| L{Moves with wind?}
  L --> |No| M1[Not a contrail]
  L --> |Yes| N{Spreads quickly?}
  N --> |No| O{Potential Shadow?}
  O --> |Yes| P1[Cloud Shadow]
  O --> |No| Q{Cloud Street Traits?}
  Q --> |Yes| R1[Cloud Street]
  Q --> |No| S{Consistent Across Wavelengths?}
  S --> |No| T1[Wavelength Inconsistency]
  S --> |Yes| U{Flight Path Reference?}
  U --> |No| V[Contrail, >90% confidence]
  U --> |Yes| W[Contrail, 60% confidence]

```

#### 1. Darkness of the object: Contrails appear darker than their surroundings in the image.
#### 2. Linearity of the object: Contrails are line-shaped clouds produced by aircraft engines.
#### 3. Object appearance: Contrails appear suddenly or enter from the sides of the image due to planes moving at high speeds.
#### 4. Object visibility: Contrails should be visible in at least two images, as they are created by moving airplanes.
#### 5. Size and shape of the object: Contrails have a length at least three times longer than their width and contain at least 10 pixels.
#### 6. Object movement: Contrails move and change shape over time due to wind influence.
#### 7. Contrail Aging and Dissipation: Contrails spread and become more diffuse over time.
#### 8. Contrail Color: Contrails' color can vary depending on the sun's position and aircraft altitude.
#### 9. Flight Path Alignment: Aligning observed contrails with known flight paths increases confidence in identification.
#### 10. Cloud Shadows: Shadows aligned with the sun's position may resemble contrails but behave differently in a sequence of images.
#### 11. Cloud Streets: Rows of cumulus clouds that are wider, less straight, and have different appearance and dissipation behavior than contrails.
#### 12. Jet Stream Impact: Contrails are influenced by high altitude winds, which can help distinguish them from other linear objects.
#### 13. Consistency Across Different Wavelengths: Consistent appearance across different wavelengths supports contrail identification.
#### 14. Consider similar objects: Cloud shadows and cloud streets can mimic contrails but exhibit different behaviors and characteristics.

### Reducing Contrail Formation: Strategies to Consider
##### Adjusting Altitudes: Change cruising altitude to avoid contrail-forming conditions, considering increased fuel use and CO2 emissions.
##### Optimizing Flight Paths: Modify routes to avoid areas with conditions conducive to contrail formation.
##### Modifying Flight Schedules: Adjust schedules to influence contrail climate effects during the day (cooling) and night (warming).
##### Enhancing Aircraft Efficiency: Improve efficiency to reduce exhaust water vapor and potentially decrease contrail occurrence.
##### Exploring Alternative Fuels: Investigate biofuels emitting less water vapor when burned to reduce contrails.
##### Utilizing Advanced Forecasts: Use weather prediction tech to identify high contrail formation areas and adjust flight paths.
