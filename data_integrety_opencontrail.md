## Roadmap - Data Quality and Integrity 

1. [ ] Load data from files, databases, APIs, etc.
2. [ ] Understand the dataset: analyze data organization, file contents, and label meanings.
3. [ ] Explore the data:
   - [ ] Check the number of records.
   - [ ] Review example records.
   - [ ] Assess the range and distribution of values.
4. [ ] Check for data presence, missing data, and empty data:
   - [ ] Ensure all expected files are present and not empty.
   - [ ] Verify data consistency across training, validation, and test sets.
5. [ ] Perform a thorough data quality and integrity check:
   - [ ] Visually inspect the data.
   - [ ] Examine data distributions.
   - [ ] Validate labels.
   - [ ] Identify and address class imbalance.
   - [ ] Explore metadata.
   - [ ] Detect and handle outliers.
6. [ ] Clean the data:
   - [ ] Handle missing values.
   - [ ] Remove duplicates.
   - [ ] Correct errors in the dataset.
7. [ ] Analyze data patterns, types, shapes, and sizes:
   - [ ] Generate a report using appropriate tools to understand the data structure.
8. [ ] Transform the data:
   - [ ] Apply necessary data transformations such as one-hot encoding, normalization, or feature engineering.
9. [ ] Conduct further data analysis:
   - [ ] Calculate and plot the proportion of contrail pixels over time.
   - [ ] Calculate the mean Dice coefficient on a validation set.
   - [ ] Display summary statistics.
   - [ ] Perform correlation analysis between different bands.
   - [ ] Apply machine learning algorithms for classification or prediction tasks.
10. [ ] Store the cleaned and transformed data in a suitable format for future use.
11. [ ] Understand the importance of data integrity:
   - [ ] Highlight the significance of data integrity in machine learning.
   - [ ] Recognize the consequences of data leakage.
   - [ ] Emphasize the need for accurate performance metrics.

Goal: Enhance contrail models' accuracy using satellite imagery, aiding airlines in minimizing contrail formation and reducing their impact on climate change.

Context: Contrails are ice crystal clouds formed in aircraft engine exhaust, contributing to global warming. This competition focuses on validating contrail prediction models using satellite imagery, enabling more reliable contrail avoidance techniques.
