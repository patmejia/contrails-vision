#### Title:
# GOES-16 Satellite Contrail Detection using CV/ML

##### Optimizing satellite imagery, [GOES-R ABI](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/index.php), and advanced computer vision/machine learning for accurate detection of contrails


#### Absract:
##### The "OpenContrails: Benchmarking Contrail Detection" paper proposes a new contrail detection model, enhancing the study of climate change. The model, leveraging multiple frames for temporal context, improves detection performance and focuses on young, linear contrails. It utilizes the OpenContrails dataset, containing human-labeled contrail detections from the GOES-16 satellite, and confirms prior contrail research. The authors present the OpenContrails dataset and model as public benchmarks, promoting advances in contrail research. This work involves contributors from Google's Research Department and MIT's Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment.

> #### Q: Why focus on contrails to curb climate change impacts?
> #### Adam Durant: It’s not just direct engine emissions that matter in terms of aviation’s climate impacts. Non-carbon dioxide sources — like the climate forcing from contrails — make up almost two-thirds of the industry’s impact, which is a surprisingly big number. In fact, it equates to 2% of all human-caused climate change.

#### Dataset: OpenContrails

#### Dataset description:
##### ☛ OpenContrails is a dataset of contrail detections from GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager data. <br> ☛ Created to train models for contrail detection and climate impact assessment. <br> ☛ Focuses on young, linear-shaped contrails due to climate change contribution. <br> ☛ Contains high-quality per-pixel contrail masks for each image. <br> ☛ Includes contrail detection model output from multiple years of GOES-16 images. <br> ☛ Images are derived from GOES-16 ABI in geostationary orbit. <br> ☛ Covers North and South American region with 10-minute interval images since April 2019. <br> ☛ Examples generated by random sampling of GOES-16 viewable extent from April 2019-2020. <br> ☛ Samples restricted within -50 to 50-degree latitude and -135 to -30-degree longitude. <br> ☛ Contrail detection model uses deep neural networks, including ResNet and DeeplabV3+ architectures. <br> ☛ Dataset and outputs are publicly available on Google Cloud Storage [bucket: gcp-public-data-goes-16](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gcp-public-data-goes-16;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false).

## ➲ Setup

#### ☛ option 1: using `conda`
```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
conda activate contrail_env
```

#### ☛ option 2: using `pip` and `venv`
```bash
python -m venv contrails_env
source contrails_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### ☛ option 3: using `conda` and `pip` ?
```bash
conda create -n contrail_env
conda activate contrail_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Both `conda`` and `pip`` can be used in the same environment, but issues may arise. Using them back-to-back can create an unreproducible state and overwrite packages. To avoid problems, create an isolated conda environment, install most packages with conda, and use pip with `--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed`.
