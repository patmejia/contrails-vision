#### Title:
# GOES-16 Satellite Contrail Detection using CV/ML

### Optimizing satellite imagery, [GOES-R ABI](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/index.php), and advanced computer vision/machine learning for accurate detection of contrails


#### Description:

##### Connecting machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) techniques to detect contrails in GOES-16 satellite data, providing valuable insights for climate change research. The contrail detection model integrates various features such as darkness, linearity, appearance, size, movement, aging, color, and flight path alignment. Additionally, strategies to mitigate contrail formation, including altitude adjustments, optimized flight paths, schedule modifications, improved efficiency, exploration of alternative fuels, and advanced weather forecasts, are considered. The availability of the OpenContrails dataset and the proposed contrail detection model contribute to advancing contrail research and promoting sustainable practices in the aviation industry.

> #### Q: Why focus on contrails to curb climate change impacts?
> #### Adam Durant: Itâ€™s not just direct engine emissions that matter in terms of aviationâ€™s climate impacts. Non-carbon dioxide sources â€” like the climate forcing from contrails â€” make up almost two-thirds of the industryâ€™s impact, which is a surprisingly big number. In fact, it equates to 2% of all human-caused climate change.
