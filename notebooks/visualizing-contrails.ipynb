The original full-disk images were reprojected using bilinear resampling to generate a local scene image. Because contrails are easier to identify with temporal context, a sequence of images at 10-minute intervals are provided. Each example contains exactly one labeled frame.\n\nLearn more about the dataset from our preprint: [OpenContrails: Benchmarking Contrail Detection on GOES-16 ABI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02122).\n\n## Files\nIn each subdirectory named by `{record_id}`, binary files in numpy `.npy` format that corresponds to a single example are provided:\n\n* **`band_{08-16}.npy`**: array with size of `H x W x T`, where `T = n_times_before + n_times_after + 1`, representing the number of images in the sequence. There are `n_times_before` and `n_times_after` images before and after the labeled frame respectively. In our dataset all examples have  `n_times_before=4` and `n_times_after=3`. Each band represents an infrared channel at different wavelengths and is converted to brightness temperatures based on the calibration parameters. The number in the filename corresponds to the GOES-16 ABI band number. Details of the ABI bands can be found [here](https://www.goes-r.gov/mission/ABI-bands-quick-info.html).\n* **`human_individual_masks.npy`**: array with size of `H x W x 1 x R`. Each example is labeled by `R` individual human labelers. `R` is not the same for all samples. The labeled masks have value either 0 or 1 and correspond to the `(n_times_before+1)`-th image in `band_{08-16}.npy`. They are available only in the training set.\n* **`human_pixel_masks.npy`**: array with size of `H x W x 1` containing the  binary groundtruth. A pixel is regarded as contrail pixel in evaluation if it is labeled as contrail by more than half of the labelers. \n\n**`{train/validation}_metadata.json`**: contains the timestamps and the projection parameters to reproduce the satellite images.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import animation\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom IPython import display","metadata":{"_uuid":"3ddfdbda-6bea-47d1-ba9d-d4acaa379ad1","_cell_guid":"c7665dd4-f4e4-48e1-93c8-8d162f664b2c","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T20:57:33.796614Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T20:57:33.797133Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T20:57:33.804971Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T20:57:33.79709Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T20:57:33.803161Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"BASE_DIR = '/kaggle/input/google-research-identify-contrails-reduce-global-warming/train'\nN_TIMES_BEFORE = 4\nrecord_id = '1704010292581573769'\n\nwith open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, record_id, 'band_11.npy'), 'rb') as f:\n    band11 = np.load(f)\nwith open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, record_id, 'band_14.npy'), 'rb') as f:\n    band14 = np.load(f)\nwith open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, record_id, 'band_15.npy'), 'rb') as f:\n    band15 = np.load(f)\nwith open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, record_id, 'human_pixel_masks.npy'), 'rb') as f:\n    human_pixel_mask = np.load(f)\nwith open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, record_id, 'human_individual_masks.npy'), 'rb') as f:\n    human_individual_mask = np.load(f)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T20:57:42.176438Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T20:57:42.176919Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T20:57:42.242845Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T20:57:42.176876Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T20:57:42.241276Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Combine bands into a false color image\nIn order to view contrails in GOES, we use the \"ash\" color scheme.
